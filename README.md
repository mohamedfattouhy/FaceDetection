## Face Detection

</div>

<br>


This project is based on the face detection project available [here](https://github.com/nicknochnack/FaceDetection/tree/main). This project aims to bring structure to the code to make it easier to understand and use. In addition, explanations are added on how to build machine learning models using the TensorFlow and Keras open source libraries.

The main aim of this project is to improve my skills in building machine learning models with the [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=fr) and [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=fr) libraries.
